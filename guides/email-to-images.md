## Generating images from emails
You can use the API to convert emails into images.

Making it easy to automatically share them in Slack, Instagram or Facebook.

**How to do it:**
1. You can use our [Zapier](/integrations/zapier) or [Make](/integrations/make) integrations to convert email to images without code.
2. Or, use the [API](/getting-started/using-the-api#creating-an-image) directly.
3. You'll want to create an image from HTML and pass the full HTML of the email to the API.
4. The API will then send back a URL to your image of the email.

For more details on how the API works, see [Creating an image](/getting-started/using-the-api#creating-an-image).

## Include full `<html>`

To render a full email or webpage with the API, pass the full HTML markup. Starting and ending with the `<html>` tags.

- The API will enter full page mode and render the entire page as displayed by Google Chrome.
- When rendering a full page, be sure to include full paths to all outside assets so that the API is able to download them. Relative paths will not work.
